# What's a Hardware Description Language?
Integrated circuit (IC), also known as a chip, are small, complex electronic components that are fundamental part of most modern electronics.
Hardware Description Language (HDL) is a computer language used to describe and build digital hardware, such as electronic circuits, digital logic circuits, and systems. HDLs are often used to design ASICs and build ICs on FPGAs. They can also be used to simulate electornic circuits and check their responses. Microcontrollers/CPUs execute instructions line by line whereas FPGA, ASIC doesn't have any instruction set, it's just pure digital hardware. For this reason, FPGA/ASIC can perform multiple tasks at the same time in a parallel manner. The code written in HDL executes in parallel, all lines at the same time, not line by line like regular programming languages. FPGA/ASIC plays a super important role in High Performance Computing and AI. Hardware acceleration for ML and AI based models can be built using FPGA. Google's TPU is one of the example of ASIC.
